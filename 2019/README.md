# Advent of Code 2019

My try on [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). <br>
The language is C++.

## How to start

Prerequirements:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

> **The project was only build on windows computers**

```shell
cmake -S <path_to_cmakelists.txt_file> -B <some_build_dir>
```
Now you can open the solution in the build directory in Visual
Studio and build it or you build it with the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt (search in Windows for "Developer Command Prompt"). <br>
In the developer command prompt type:
```shell
cd <path_to_build_dir>
devenv AOC_2019.sln /Build
```
